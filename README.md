## Introduction

Linked Listing was created to address the demand for a free marketplace cross-posting platform accessible to all users.
Unlike other apps in this space, Linked Listing doesn't impose a paywall, making it more accessible to standard users.

In this application, users can:
- **Inventory Page:**
     - View and manage their supplies
          - Monitor supplies running low
- **Listings Page:**
     - View all listings and specific listing details
          - Delete listings
- **Messages Page:**
     - Access a condensed notification inbox
     - Track viewed notifications
- **Profile Page:**
     - Manage linked accounts
     - Change password
     - Logout

## Installation

To view and run our file structure, follow these steps:

1. Install Android Studio with the default settings and emulation tools.
2. Download a zip file of the code from this GitHub Repository.
3. Unzip the file in the project directory of your Android Studio.
4. Launch the project, allow the program to index the files, and sync the Gradle files.
5. Run the app on the built-in emulator (the default is a Pixel 3A).

In the future, we will provide a link to the compiled application for download.

## Usage

Upon signing up/logging in, a user should navigate to the profile tab to link their external marketplace accounts.
Once an account has been linked, a user can move to the listings page and begin listing items. In addition to the listings tab,
the user can also navigate to the inventory page to add the various supplies they own, as well as the quantity of each of their supplies.
They can set a threshold for what quantity of a certain supply warrants an alert.

## Resources + Tools

Throughout the development of Linked Listing, we have a combination of resources, languages, and tools in order to achieve our goals:

- Android Studio: IDE with a build in emulator to facilitate the development of Android apps.
- Gradle: Build automation tool used to manage the various dependencies (such as library dependencies).
- Java: The primary programming language we chose to write the front end in.
- XML: The markup langauge that Android applications use to draw and format the UI.
- GitHub: Version control system as well as the repository.
